SOLID PRINCIPLE - s/w design principle 

S :Single Responsibility principle
O :Open-Close principle
L :Liskov Substitution principle
I :Interface Segregation principle
D :dependency injection principle

#SOLID principles are all intertwined and interdependent
#they are most effective when they are combined together

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
    -Every s/w component (component can be 
    a class, a method, or a module) should have one 
    and only one responsibility or
        >(modified definition):
            Every s/w component should have 
            one and only one reason to change
    -Aims for High Cohesion
    -Aims for Loose Coupling


    Cohesion:
        -It is the degree to which the various 
        parts of a s/w components are related
        -Higher Cohesion helps attain better 
        adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle
            >we should always aim for a higher Cohesion
            within a component(ie class,..)

    Coupling:
        -Coupling is defined as the level of inter
        dependency b/w various s/w components
        -Loose Coupling helps attain better adherence to 
        the Single Responsibility Principle(SRP)

        #Tight-Coupling is bad in s/w


Open-Closed Principle (OCP):
    -s/w components should be Closed for modification,
    but open for extension
        >closed for modification:
            >>New features getting added to the s/w
             component should NOT have to modify existing code

        >Open for extension:
            >>A s/w component should be extendable 
            to add a new feature or to add a new
            behavior to it
    
    adv:
        -Ease of adding new features
        -Leads to minimal cost of developing 
        and testing s/w
        -Open closed principle often requires
        decoupling, which, in turn, automatically
        follows the SRP 
        -we get robust design that are easy to 
        implement in future (by following ocp)
    
    Caution:
        -Do not follow open closed principle blindly
        -you will end up with a huge number of classes that
        can complicate your overall design


Liskov Substitution Principle(LSP):
    -Objects should be replacable with their subtypes 
    without affecting the correctness of the program
