API (Application Programmable Interface)
    -Documented way in which external consumers
    can understand how they can interact with your 
    code (not how your code works but how they 
    can interact with your code to get their work done)

    or
    -An API is a software contract which defines the
    expectations and interactions of a piece of code
    exposed to external users. This includes the parameters, 
    response, errors and API name

----------------RESTful APIs with JAX-RS---------------

1. REST concepts: (REpresentational State Transfer)
    While designing rest apis keep following in mind
    >Resource based URIs : use these
    >HTTP methods: use suitable http method
    >HTTP Status Codes: response need to return the 
    right http status codes
    >Message header: all req and resp need to have right headers

Web Service:
    -services that are exposed to the internet 
    for programmatic access, their online apis 
    we can call from our code
    
    Characteristics:
        -the exchange of data happens over the web/http
        -the client sends http request and the server
        sends back the http response
            >the client then have its own logic to 
            present the data to the user in the presentable
            format.
        -protocol =>message format in which client 
            and server communicates 
         Rest services can send the message in any format
         json/xml/text wtever as long as the client and 
         server understands each other, theres no fixed protocol

        -method need to used :->methods can be exchanged 
         on any or all http methods, there r few guidelines defined
         but there aint any specific fixed method

        -Service Definition: definiton of the service, 
        the type of input/parameters/outputs etc -->
        theres no such formal service definition available
        in the restful web services

    #REST is inspired by lot of the concepts of http 
    (hyper text transfer protocol)

HTTP specifications or rules:
    -hyper text transfer protocol
    -the stuff we exchange and transfer in http is 
    called hypertext
    Hypertext:
        -structured form of text 
        with interesting property as follows->
        it contains logical links to other texts
            >this links are called hyper links

        -a common and very popular way to write 
        hypertext is HTML(Hyper Text Markup language)

    Adrress:
        -URIs
            1. Instance Resource based URIs -> messages/messageId/comments/commentId  
            2. Collection Resource URIs -> /messages or /commnets <- lists collection of messages or comments respectively

    HTTP Methods:
        -verbs that are used to interact with the servers
        -get, post, put, delete
    
        #IDEMPOTENCE is the property of certain 
        operations, that can be applied multiple times 
        without changing the result beyond the initial application
        (ie no changes after first change, even when called multiple times)

        GET, PUT, DELETE -> idempotent methods
        POST -> non-idempotent method

        #http specifications(rules) requires it, ie get, put, delete 
        methods to be idempotent ie the client need not to worry 
        about making duplicate requests. 
        But if they are making post request they can not make
        any duplicate post request without making any change on the 
        server 

        eg-> post -> message/ --> create a new message(message inside the post body) with id say 21 and will respond this id 
            now again if the same post request is made (ie for same message)
            post -> message/  --> then this time it'll again post this msg with other message id say 22  ie now this time duplicate message got created



    #a good  restful api makes good use of all these
    http methods
    
    Metadata: 
        HTTP Status Code: the number that shows up on 
        the very first line of the http response, 
        it indicates if the response was successful 
        or there was an errors. 

        status code-> 
            200 - Success
            500 - Server Error
            404 - Not found

    Header value:
        -contains metadata/headers in every http req and response
            >meta data about the message (like the content type/formats the msgs r in)
        -there r some standard predefined content type values like -> 
            text/xml - for xml content
            application/json - for json content
    
    #a message thats send with the right content type is easily 
    readable by the server and the client, because 
    they actually examine the header and checks the format and 
    then parse it accordingly


#URI -> uniform resource identifier
#URL is a special type of URI 

#while designing restful APIs we need to have 
Resource basesd URIs




Returning XML Response steps-
1. Create the necessary model and service classes
2. Ensure the model classes have no-argument constructor
    ##u need the framework to be able to create new instances
    of class 
    eg. suppose we have constructor like -
    public Message(long id, String message, String author) {
		super();
		this.id = id;
		this.message = message;
		this.created = new Date();
		this.author = author;
	}
    
    then make sure to add -->
    public Message(){
    
    }

3. Call the service from MessageResource and return response.
4. Update the @Produces annotation to XML format
5. Annotate Model class with @XmlRootElement






**********
DOCKER:
    -docker is a tool used to automate the deployment of applications
    in lightweight containers so that applications can work efficiently
    in different environments.
    -multiple containers run on the same hardware
    -maintains isolated applications
    -highly productive
    -quick and easy configuration

    #Container: is a s/w package that consists of all the dependencies
    required to run an application.

    How does it work:
        flow:
        Docker engine [
            Client (Docker CLI) <-> Rest API <-> Server (docker daemon) //these are all inside docker engine
        ]
        -Docker engine or docker is the base engine installed on your host m/c
        to build and run containers using Docker components and services
        -It uses client-server architecture
        -Docker client and server communicate using Rest API.
            -Docker client is a service which runs a command.
            -The command is translated using REST api and is sent
            to the docker daemon(server)
            -Then, the docker daemon checks the client request
            and interacts with the os in order to create or manage
            containers

    Components of Docker:
        1. Docker Client and Service
        2. Docker Images
        3. Docker Containers
        4. Docker Registry
