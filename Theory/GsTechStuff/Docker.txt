DOCKER:
    -docker is a tool used to automate the deployment of applications
    in lightweight containers so that applications can work efficiently
    in different environments.
    -multiple containers run on the same hardware
    -maintains isolated applications
    -highly productive
    -quick and easy configuration

    #Container: is a s/w package that consists of all the dependencies
    required to run an application.

    How does it work:
        flow:
        Docker engine [
            Client (Docker CLI) <-> Rest API <-> Server (docker daemon) //these are all inside docker engine
        ]
        -Docker engine or docker is the base engine installed on your host m/c
        to build and run containers using Docker components and services
        -It uses client-server architecture
        -Docker client and server communicate using Rest API.
            -Docker client is a service which runs a command.
            -The command is translated using REST api and is sent
            to the docker daemon(server)
            -Then, the docker daemon checks the client request
            and interacts with the os in order to create or manage
            containers

    Components of Docker:
        1. Docker Client and Service
        2. Docker Images
        3. Docker Containers
        4. Docker Registry
