DOCKER:
    -docker is a tool used to automate the deployment of applications
    in lightweight containers so that applications can work efficiently
    in different environments.
    -multiple containers run on the same hardware
    -maintains isolated applications
    -highly productive
    -quick and easy configuration

    #Container: is a s/w package that consists of all the dependencies
    required to run an application.

    How does it work:
        flow:
        Docker engine [
            Client (Docker CLI) <-> Rest API <-> Server (docker daemon) //these are all inside docker engine
        ]
        -Docker engine or docker is the base engine installed on your host m/c
        to build and run containers using Docker components and services
        -It uses client-server architecture
        -Docker client and server communicate using Rest API.
            -Docker client is a service which runs a command.
            -The command is translated using REST api and is sent
            to the docker daemon(server)
            -Then, the docker daemon checks the client request
            and interacts with the os in order to create or manage
            containers

    Components of Docker:
        1. Docker Client and Service:
            -Docker client is accessed from the terminal and docker
            host runs the docker daemon and registry
            -a user can build docker images and run docker containers
            by passing commands from docker client to docker server
        2. Docker Images:
            -docker image is a template with instructions, which is
            used for creating docker containers.
            -docker image is build using the file called Docker File.
            -docker image is stored in a docker hub or in a repository
            (like registry.hub.Docker.com)

            Syntax of creating Docker Container using Docker Image:

                >Docker container create [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND][ARG....]

        3. Docker Containers:
            -standalone executable s/w package which includes applications
            and their dependencies.
            -numerous docker containers run on the same infrastructure
            and share operating system with its other containers
            -here, each application run in isolation
        4. Docker Registry:
            -docker registry is an open-source server-side service
            used for hosting and distributing images
            -docker also has its own default registry called dockr hub
            -here images can be stored in either public or private repository
            -Pull and Push are the commands used by users in order to
            interact with a docker registry
                SYNTAX:
                    > Docker pull <image>:<tag>: pulls an image from DTR (docker repository)
                    > Docker push <image>:<tag>: pushes an image to DTR

            #public repositories can be used to host docker images which
            can be used by everyone

        #summary:
            -docker file creates a docker image using the build command
            -a docker image contains all the project's code
            -Using docker image any user can run the code in order to
            create docker containers
            -once a docker image is built, its uploaded in registry or dockr hub
            -from docker hub users can get docker image and build new containers.

Docker :
	- Its a way to package s/w so that it can run on any hardware.

DockerFile:
	-A blueprint for building a docker image
	-FROM : from required imageName
	-WORKDIR : add our source code to the image,
	 it is like when you cd into a directory, now any subsequent instruction
	 in the docker file will start from this directory
	 -COPY :
	 -RUN :
	 -ENV :
	 -EXPOSE :
	 -CMD [" ", " "] : how to run the actual application

	 #Every instruction in the dockerfile is considered its own step or layer
Images:
	-A template for running docker containers.
Containers:
	-A running process


##Docker Compose: tool for running multiple docker containers at the same time



Docker CheatSheet


1. Build your image
					docker build -t my-node-img .
2. Show specific image
					docker image ls my-node-img
3. To see all images on your machine
					docker image ls
4. Create a container with the tiny package, a name, and port
					docker create --init --name my-app -p 3000:3000 my-node-img
5. Show newly created container
					docker ps -a --filter "name=my-app"
6. Start your container
					docker start my-app
7. Attach to container (not recommended)
					docker attach my-app
8. See containers logs (recommended)
					docker logs -f my-app
9. Access container's system
					docker exec -it my-app bash
10. Using the run shortcut
					docker run --name my-app -p 3000:3000 -d --init --rm my-node-img
11. Stop a running container
					docker stop my-app
12. Remove a non-running container
					docker rm my-app
13. see all running containers
					docker ps
14. stop all running containers
					docker stop $(docker ps -q)
15. Check version of linux for container
					docker run node:12-slim cat /etc/issue
