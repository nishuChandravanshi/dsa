Def:
    -Maven is a build tool,
     developed by java,
     automates most common build tasks that r needed
    to be done
    -Dependency Management
    -repository system
    -plugin framework : nearly all functionality
     in maven is provided by plugins
    
    *configuration = arrangement of parts or elements in
       a particular form, figure or combination

Overview:
    -Convention over configuration
        >can provide functionality with a litlle/no configuration
    -POM (Project Object Model)
        > the way to structure our builds in maven
    -Dependency Resolution
    -Maven repository
    -Lifecycle, Phases, and Goals
    -Plugin Architecture

POM 
    -Object-based representation of a build 
    -Project meta data
        >Coordinates(Group, Artifact,version)
        POM defines all the project Meta data 
        like project name, date when it was started, version 
    -Dependencies
    -Build settings
    -Inheritence/super pom



Lifecycle, Phases and Goals, and Plugins:

    -maven has 3 main groups of actions for executing builds or other tasks
    
    1. Goals
        - Tasks that do the work
        - defined by plugins
        -it is the combination of maven plugin name and 
        a specific goal name on that plugin
        eg. 
            mvn compiler:compile (<- compile goal which is the part of the compiler plugin)

        

    2. Phases:
        -phases maps to one or many goals and is
        related to the grater Lifecycle
        -part of Lifecycle
        eg. 
            mvn compile (<-the compile phase may call compiler:compile goal for jar projects)


    3. Lifecycle:
        -combination of related phases 
        -Lifecycle contains phases, phases map to goal
        -different based on packaging type
        -Executes all phases up to specific phase 
        eg:
            package  phase contains jar:jar(maven goal)

        -when we specify a phase within a Lifecycle
        all phases leading upto that phase are executed.
        eg: if we call the "package" phase  the "compile", "test"
        and several other phases are executed first


    4. Plugins:
        -nearly everything is a plugin 
        -provides more functionality that can be executed during a built
        -extend maven
        -adds more goals that can be executed within a maven built
        -plugins are also Dependencies that need to be downloaded before used

    

Maven Life-cycles 


                        Jar Build Lifecycle         Maven Goals 
                        
                        compile                     compiler:compile 
Maven   )               test                        surefire: test 
Lifecycle )==>          package  ==>                jar:jar 
Phases )                install                     install:install 
                        deploy                      deploy:deploy 
        
        #if a specific phase is executed all the phases above it will be
        executed first eg package follows compile and test before it 


Commands:

    # > ./maven-tools/start.sh mavenProjectName 
        -this creates a new maven project named mavenProjectName 

    1. > mvn package ->  to build 
        #package is the name of the phase we want to target 
        after this ->
        > ls -> a new target directory formed 
        > cd target
        > ls -> maven archiver yourProject.jar 
    
    2. > mvn clean   (deletes the target directory formed by earlier build) -> clean is the clean phase thats part of the clean Lifecycle
        after this cmd 
        > ls -> target directory will be removed ie back to original source of our projet that was there before build 
        
        > mkdir -p src/main/java 
            => -p creates all the directory to the lowest level and then the full path where we need to go

        > jar -tf fileName.jar ==> shows the content of the specified jar file 


    3.  we can specify multiple goals or phases in the cmd line 

        > mvn clean package 
            (runs clean phase within the clean Lifecycle and then package phase within the default Lifecycle)

        > .gitingnore file 
            -format -> one expression per line
            -files or directories specified in this file will not be committed to git repo 
        
        > ls -l
            -list files & directories with details 

    #maven compiles the source file(eg java source) and then 
    at the end puts it(ie compiled file abc.class) into a jar file 
    
    #jar is the default packaging of maven. 

    # > jar -tf fileName.jar --> list the content of jar file 


        >ls -al -> all files and folders including . files/folders 
        
    4. mvn clean install -> smtg related to maintaining versions 
        -cd /.m2/repository -->see 

        >git add -A 
            -add everything recursively 
            eg src/main/java/sample <- this will be added recursively like src folder then main then java and so on ..

        > git log --oneline  
            -see commits of the project in formatted oneline manner 


    ## Maven Central contains all libraries (Dependencies) of maven 
       can browse maven central and look for any Dependencies if reqd so.
