mongoDB:
    -Humongous DB
    -its a database solution

flow->
    Drivers/Shell -> (queries) -> MongoDB Server -> (after doing several operations)
    ->Storage Engine->(stores the info in files at the end)-> File Sytem
    
    #(=>actions performed<=)
    # Wired Tiger is the default storage engine and is very powerful as well
    # Now if we have a closer look at that data layer with the server, the storage engine and the file system, 
    then we actually have to differentiate 
    between writing and reading from files which is a bit slower and writing
    and reading from memory which is faster.
    The storage engine actually does both,
    it loads a chunk of data into memory and
    manages that such that the data you often use is in memory of
    possible,it also writes data in memory at first so that this is really fast
    but then of course it also goes ahead and stores data in the database files.

mongo       : to start service

show dbs    :to show the databases 
                >admin, config, local <- these r 3 default databases
                    which contains some metadatas

use dbName  :"use" cmd to connect wid database,
                >we can connect with xyz db even if its not existing yet,
                it will be created once you start inserting data


db.collectionName.insertOne({key: "value"})
            this will insert the info in the collection product(even though it was not existing yet)
            , insertOne will create if not existing and then insert the info it
        
            :eg. db.products.insertOne({name: "Maths Book", price: 15.90})
            >this will insert a document(in the products collection)
             with the name and a price

db.collectionName.find()
            :this will give all the data in that collection 
            eg. db.products.find()
                >{ "_id" : ObjectId("604f5129c54117911a900fbb"), "name" : "Maths Book", "price" : 15.9 }
                #mongodb will automatically assign an id (_id) to all the docutments

    db.collection.find().pretty() 
                :to output above info in a prettier way
                > 
                {
                        "_id" : ObjectId("604f5129c54117911a900fbb"),
                        "name" : "Maths Book",
                        "price" : 15.9
                }
    
    #we can also insert nested docutments like
    eg. 
    db.products.insertOne({name:"computer",
    price:30000, description:"high quality computer",
    details:{
        cpu:"Interl core i3"
        memory: 64
    }}
    )
