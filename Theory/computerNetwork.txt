Network:
    -A n/w consist of two or more computers that are
    linked together in order to share resources(such
    as printers, CDs), exchange files, or allow electronic
    communications. The computers on a network may be 
    linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, 
    satellites, or infrared light beams.

    Two common types of networs are ->
    1. LAN (Local Area Network)
        A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network that is
        confined to a relatively small area. 
        It is generally limited to a geographic 
        area such as a writing lab, school, or building.
    2. WAN (Wide Area Network)    
        Wide Area Networks (WANs) connect networks 
        in larger geographic areas, such as Florida, 
        the United States, or the world. 
        Dedicated transoceanic cabling or satellite 
        uplinks may be used to connect this type of global network.

Protocol:
    -a set of rules that governs the communications 
    b/w computers on a network. 
    -Inorder for two computers to talk to each other
    they must be speaking the same language. 
    Many different types of network protocols and
    standards are required to ensure that your computer
    (no matter which operating system, network card, or application you are using)
    can communicate with another computer located on the 
    next desk or half-way around the world.

OSI -> Open System Interconnection Reference model 
    -defines seven layers of networking protocols.
    
OSI Layer	Name	        Common Protocols
7	        Application	    HTTP | FTP | SMTP | DNS | Telnet
6	        Presentation	
5	        Session	
4	        Transport	    TCP | SPX
3	        Network	        IP | IPX
2	        Data Link	    Ethernet
1	        Physical        Ethernet

@ravindraBabuRavula

IP address = Network ID + Host ID
    >use NID to reach the target n/w
    >use HID to reach the target host

    #and inorder to reach the target process ->
    Port number is reqd

    #for web servives (eg www.google.com), 
    using http, port number is 80(globally known)

Flow ->
www.google.com in my computer --> reaching google say at california

    flow:
    domain name(www.google.com) -> IP addrss(NID+HID)
    ->reaching target Network with the help of NID->
    reaching target Host with the help of HID ->
    port number reqd to reach the target process 

    #Convertime Domain Name into IP address: 
        >the ISP(internet service provider) provides
        DNS (Domain Name services) 
        >So initially we contact DNS(aka DNS overhead) which gives 
        the IP address of the domain we want, then 
        our computers saves the IP address of that domain
        for some time so as when we need it next time
        we dont have to contact DNS again. 


    #most of the port numbers are already predefined and
    are fixed for the well known services



Ip address = n bits => k + (n-k)) -->(=>NID+HID)
                    =>2^k no. of networks
                    and also 
                    => 2^(n-k) size of each n/w
                    (ie total number of hosts in that n/w)
                    (since hostId is n-k bits => 2^(n-k) different hosts)

eg:
n = 32 bit -> 8+24 (nid + hid)
    =>2^8 = 256 networks
    and 2^24 = 16*2^20 = 16 million (=>is huge) ip addresses are present in each n/w
    ---> this type of partition of hid nd nid is 
    not scalable and hence is not used generally 


#dotted decimal representation of ip address ->
dividing the 32 bits into 4 parts of each 8 bit
->then writing each parts decimal with dots
