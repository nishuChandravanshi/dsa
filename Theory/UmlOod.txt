UML (Unified Modeling Language)

why UML:
    -Be able to design a SW system
    -understand and apply OO-principles
    -describe your design using a standard Language
    -UML: common diagramming techniques

## Use-case diagrams, Class diagrams, Sequence diagramming,
    activity and state diagram

THE WATERFALL MODEL
    -Linear Model, defines develpt steps/phases
    -start one step->complete it->start another step
    -this approach gives us steady downward order=>waterfall

    -the development process flows in cascades
        > each development phase requires the previous one to be complete
        ie each phase builds upon the prev one

    Phases: 
        1. Collect and analyse requirements
            > the expected functionality of the 
            future application must be clarified with the stakeholders
            > all the details must be documented thouroughly
            > this is very important phase
        
        2. Architecture definition
            > define the overall designe of our s/w
            > defining architecture is like creating a 
            blueprint for a building
            > the team should be able to implement the 
            product based on this plan    
            > we should address questions like: 
                >>packages/components:
                 what packages or components will form our system
                >> key types:
                 what are the fundamental types of each component 
                >> Interactions:
                 how do this types interact with each other 
                to achieve the required functionality
                >> Security:
                 Is our s/w secure
                >> performance 
                >> Fault-tolerance: how does our s/w respond to errors
                >> Robustness: 
                  how do we handle edge cases
                >> Extensibility: should extend our syst in future?
                >> 3rd party components usage
        
        3. Implementation
            > s/w development is divided into small units
            each unit is implemented nd tested seperately
            > after completion of development phase->
            the product undergoes the verification phase

        4. Verification 
            > s/w is evaluated based on predefined criteria
        
            >Testing
                >> Functional, performance, security, usabilitye issues r tested
                >> detected problems r recorded nd fixed. 
                >> the process goes on until all severe bugs r fixed

        5. Maintainance  
            >fixing small bugs
            >small enhancements on functionality
            # avoid making substantial changes during
             maintance phase, instead u should set up a 
             new waterfall project nd repeat all the steps

    
    # Waterfall Model used for: 
        -Life-control systems
        -Medical systems
        -Military systems 
    
    # use waterfall model if
        -The requirements are clearly defined
        and wont change frequently
    
    # disadv:
        -new requirements cant be considered at later phases



THE AGILE APPROACH
    -agile manifesto(2001)
        > aimed to end the proliferation of s/w 
        development methodologies
         # proliferation=rapid increase in no. or rapid growth
   
    -main idea is to provide functional s/w iteratively
    instead of delivering the entire project all at once
        >the work is broken into smaller chunks called SPRINTS
    -testing is not seperated from devpt (unlike waterfall model)
        >testing is tightly integrated w/d the devpt
        nd entire team owns the responsibility of the quality of the product
    -involving the business users int the devpt process stands
    at the core 
    -works best where the reqt cant be defined upfront       

    # Agile is NOT a METHODOLOGY, but rather a way of 
     thinking defined by Agile Manifesto

    agile Values:
        1. Individual and Interactions over process nd tools
        2. Working s/w over comprehensive documentation
        3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
        4. Responding to change over following a plan

    agile frameworks eg. :
        -Scrum, Kanban

    adv:
        > more flexible comp. to waterfall model
        > welcomes changes even at the later phases
        of the devpt cycle
        > detailed plan for the entire project b4 starting 
        any devpt is not required 
            >> we r not blocked until each nd every requirements
            are defined
        > stakeholders have a chance to evaluate the s/w nd provide
        their feedback early on, rather than waiting for the
        final product to be delivered
        > leads to higher customer satisfactions
        nd team members will likely be more motivated
        by engaging customers directly


***********************
Non-Structured Programming(1950)
    problem: 
        -Spaghetti code: complicated, diffi to understand nd maintain

Structured Programming(1960)
    -break down code into logical steps
    -relies on subroutines 
    -improves code readability

    eg. C(1969)
    
    problems:
        -as the problems got bigger
            >Structured programming could not address
             all the increased complexity


Object-oriented programming
    -idea is to split the program into self-contained objects
    -aims to bring programming closer to real world
